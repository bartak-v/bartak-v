### Hey ðŸ‘‹
#### Name's VÃ­t BartÃ¡k 
I am currently a student in a master's degree CS program on the [FIT BUT](https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en). Started my CS journey as a bachelor on [FNSPE CTU](https://www.fjfi.cvut.cz/en/) in Prague, where I graduated from Software Engineering.

Although I am mostly interested in cybersecurity, cryptography and backend development, I don't mind getting my hands on other fields aswell: ML/AI, a bit of frontend and last but not least: scripting (Bash, Python). Broadly speaking, the whole of Computer Science interests me (as it should).
